# Taro Challenge

Allows you to watch all of [大阪太郎](https://www.youtube.com/c/%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E-%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96%E9%85%8D%E4%BF%A1%E3%81%8C%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3)'s videos, from oldest to newest.

This project is designed to help Japanese learners get through an entire channel's playlist with the aim of improving their Japanese comprehension. The video index is saved on local storage, so when you open the browser again, you can continue watching from where you left off.

Written in React Native and deployed with Expo-Cli.
